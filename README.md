##

Fiction fusion combines the power of GPT-3 with the convenience of NestJS to bring the user a unique writing experience. With Fiction Fusion, you can collaborate with an artificial intelligence to co-write stories and explore new creative possibilities.  Give it a try and see where your imagination takes you!
## Research
This project was created as part of a research at Leiden University. To learn more about the research behind this project, please see our [Exploration document](docs/FF_Research.pdf). This document describes the motivations for developing a co-creative system for story-telling and provides possible complications.

## Evaluation
To understand how the creativity of the system was evaluated, please see our [evaluation document](docs/FF_creative_Evaluation.pdf). This document describes the human evaluation that was conducted to assess the capabilities and limitations of the system, as well as the results of the evaluation.

## Story book
We are proud to present the best stories generated by our test group in collaboration with the AI in [our Storybook](docs/FF_Storybook.pdf). These stories showcase the creativity and innovation that can be achieved through co-creative systems like Fiction Fusion. We hope you enjoy reading these stories and appreciate the unique perspectives and ideas that they bring to the world of story-telling.
